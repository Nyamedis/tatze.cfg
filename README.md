It shoud look like this (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg) this is the path when ur installed it on ur C disk

just put the .cfg file in there


to loade the cfg in cs2 u need to open ur consol (the cs consol for idiots:3) and type exec tatze.cf (in case u renamed it the new name of the .cfg file)
